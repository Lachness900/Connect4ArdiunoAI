# Connect4ArdiunoAI
This project is a branch from :https://projecthub.arduino.cc/markbennettuk/da5a332f-9bc5-4bfa-8011-25dea4ff80c2. 

This was a major project during year 10 that was originally going to come with a robot but lockdown happened.
I had to pivot and code the project on my ardiuno at home.



But I improved the code by adding:
 - A significantly better AI
    - Added a bias towards playing in the center
    - Added a an element of randomness
    - Allowed it to see one step further into the future(Only to check if it would lose)
 - A difficulty setting for the AI - make it more or less random
 - Made it play in the console/removed libraries required for specific hardware
